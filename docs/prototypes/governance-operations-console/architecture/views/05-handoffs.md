# Handoff And Transition Map

Status: approved pre-baseline target projection.

Source: [`system-model.yaml`](../system-model.yaml). Every row below maps to one
transition id in that model.

## Standard Transition Protocol

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor Operator
  participant Source as Source domain
  participant WGCF as Validation authority
  participant Target as Target admission owner
  participant OOS as Workflow execution
  participant Authority as Mutation authority
  participant Console as Console projection

  Operator->>Source: Confirm intent
  Source->>Source: Freeze source id + version
  Source->>WGCF: Versioned packet + actor + idempotency
  WGCF-->>Source: Validation result
  Source->>Target: Request target admission
  Target-->>Source: Admission decision
  Source->>OOS: Authorized command
  OOS->>Authority: Execute bounded mutation
  Authority-->>OOS: Result + authority receipt
  OOS-->>Source: Correlated final receipt
  Source-->>Console: Refreshed read model
```

A transition may stop after validation, admission, or rejection. Only an
authority-owned result and reconciled receipt permit the Console to project
application or completion.

## Domain Handoffs

| Transition | Trigger and target completion | Console | Backend | Adapter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Proposal to Delivery | Accepted Proposal selects Delivery; a Delivery ingress receipt creates an Intake source while Proposal remains accepted. | prototype-only | implemented | missing |
| Proposal to Prototype | Accepted Proposal selects exploration; a Prototype receipt creates an `exploring` record with Landing required. | prototype-only | missing | missing |
| Proposal Repository Gate | Selected route needs new or clarified source custody; an active workspace repository ref returns control to Proposal handoff. | prototype-only | missing | missing |
| Repository Request and Provisioning | Operator or upstream domain requests durable source; physical repository, ownership, README, and AGENTS evidence reconcile without implying workspace classification. | prototype-only | partial | missing |
| Prototype to Delivery | Baseline-approved Prototype prepares graduation; Delivery Consume creates or reuses the ART shell and final receipt marks graduation. | prototype-only | missing | missing |
| Delivery Owner Repo Catalog Link | Active Delivery needs an active workspace repo as `Owner Repo`; catalog add, link, sync, and work-item update reconcile. | prototype-only | partial | missing |
| Repository to Workspace Intake | A provisioned repo emits a generic entrant packet; Workspace Governance records one explicit intake classification without creating active inventory. | not-started | partial | missing |
| Prototype to Workspace Intake | Prototype establishes a new durable repo, product, or component boundary; the originating workflow submits a generic entrant packet. | not-started | partial | missing |
| Delivery to Workspace Intake | Delivery discovers a new durable repo, product, or component boundary; the originating workflow submits a generic entrant packet. | partial | partial | missing |
| Workspace Intake to Active Inventory | An admitted entrant satisfies type-specific requirements; one governed change removes it from intake and adds it to exactly one active inventory contract. | partial | partial | missing |
| Active Product to Portfolio | An active `products.yaml` product has a product-owner publication packet and operating evidence; Portfolio projects one policy-permitted listing. | prototype-only | missing | missing |
| Existing Product Update to Portfolio | Delivery closeout or a release produces outcome evidence against an active product ref; the product owner assembles the versioned publication packet and the existing listing updates without duplicate identity. | partial | missing | missing |

## Workspace Intake Split

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Candidate["Originating workflow<br/>generic entrant packet"]
  Classification["Workspace Intake classification"]
  Register["intake-register.yaml"]
  Promotion["Active inventory promotion"]
  Inventory["repos.yaml / products.yaml / components.yaml"]

  Candidate --> Classification
  Classification -->|out-of-scope / proposed / admitted| Register
  Register -->|admitted + type-specific readiness| Promotion
  Promotion -->|remove intake + add one active record| Inventory
```

Classification and promotion are separate workflows and receipts. A
classification receipt cannot satisfy an active-inventory requirement.

## Operational Handoffs

| Transition | Trigger and target completion | Console | Backend | Adapter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Model Profile Request | Operator requests creation or lifecycle change; source-backed registry, access, OOS, and Security evidence reconcile. | not-started | missing | missing |
| Orchestration Definition Admission | Reviewed executable source is ready; OOS exposes one immutable active definition version. | prototype-only | missing | missing |
| Durable Orchestration Run | Approved domain command matches an active definition; a durable adapter returns a reconciled final receipt. | prototype-only | missing | missing |
| Dev Integration Profile Request | Component needs a fast integration lane; admitted active profile and owner commands exist without implying stage. | prototype-only | partial | missing |
| Governed Product Release | Product descriptor permits an operation; Platform and product projections reconcile with an immutable receipt. | prototype-only | partial | missing |
| Governed Context to Agent | Context candidate is admitted; Agent Console receives only a model-safe packet and receipt references. | partial | partial | missing |

## Ownership Pattern

| Concern | Default owner |
| --- | --- |
| Source packet and correction | Source domain authority |
| Policy and readiness evaluation | WGCF or the named governing authority |
| Target admission | Target domain authority |
| Workflow correlation and bounded retry | OOS, except CGG-owned context admission |
| Canonical mutation | Authority named by the target record |
| Final receipt | Execution or target authority named in the transition |
| Operator projection | Console read model, derived from the above |

Lifecycle Transitions projects these stages across domains. It does not choose
the route, grant approval, execute the mutation, or own the canonical receipt.

## Implementation Rule

- `approved-target` records the intended architecture.
- `prototype-only` means the interaction is testable against structured local
  fixtures and receipts only.
- `missing` backend or adapter status keeps the live action unavailable.
- Post-baseline implementation is split by authority and adapter ownership; it
  is not landed as one Console-owned cross-repo patch.
